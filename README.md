Using breadth-first search (bfs) in python, I made a reactive agent that moves randomly until it detects an object a grid away in a north, south, east or west direction. When it detects the object, it takes it and takes it to the base, always avoiding obstacles. I took as a model the series "South Park", where towelie is my agent, the joints are the object and the police are the obstacles.
